### WHAT IS THIS INFORMATION
#
# This is data used for https://bewares.getfursu.it/ (navigate to the URL to learn more).
# In short, it is a search tool based on information available at https://artistsbeware.info/ .
#
# !!! IF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE HERE CANNOT BE FOUND/CONFIRMED ON ARTISTSBEWARE.INFO,  !!!
# !!! THE INFORMATION HERE MUST BE CONSIDERED FALSE AND/OR A HUMAN ERROR AND/OR OUTDATED. !!!
#
# The information here is not intended to be used by humans or other living entities. If you found this using
# a search engine like Ecosia, Google, Bing, etc., please continue searching.
# These are instructions for the software generating https://bewares.getfursu.it/ aimed at creating
# more consistent report. The fact of providing this information here is for the purpose of transparency
# and software maintainability ("bus factor").
#
# Every change applied SHOULD be described in the `why` field.
# Every change MUST include the original value in the `from` field.
# If the `from` value differs from the data pulled from artistsbeware.info, the change MUST NOT be applied.
#
# Explanation of some fixes:
#   "(not) expected" - the software expects some typical formatting, order of information.
#                      Some changes are done to let the report be generated without failures or inconsistencies.
#
#   "unusual" - as above, the software was made to handle most of the posts (most typical formatting). The unusual
#               formatting is changed here to meet the expectations.
#
#   "unused" - some of the information is not being used during generation of the report and would obscure it.
#              It is meaningful only on artistsbeware.info.
#
#   "broken URL" - some URLs ("links") in the artistsbeware.info information are broken (as submitted by the authors?).
#
#   "typo" - to generate consitsent report, typos need to be fixed. Everynoe makes typos, sometmies.
